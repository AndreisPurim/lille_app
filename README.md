# Lille APP

This is an idea for an APP inspired by [UTFApp](https://www.facebook.com/utfapp/) and [GDE](https://grade.daconline.unicamp.br/) and is basically a twin to my other project Unicamp-App. The idea is basically an App that concentrates GDE's functionalities in an App with a few more features to finally cocentrar all Lille's stuff in one place.
